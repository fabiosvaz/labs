# Overview
Steps to guide you on how to deploy Kubernetes Dashboard in k8s cluster environment.

Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface that allows us to manage a k8s cluster (modify Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets), monitor and troubleshoot app deployments, as well as deploy new deploy containerized applications.

Dashboard also provides information on the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster and on any errors that may have occurred.

*This hands-on has been tested with Kubernetes Dashboard v1.10.1*
